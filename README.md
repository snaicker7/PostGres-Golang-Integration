# PostGres-Golang-Integration

# 1. Import the following packages:-		
   a. database/sql is the package for establishing connection with the database
   b. github.com/lib/pq is the driver
   
           import (
        	    "database/sql"
        	    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
            )
   
# 2. Connecting with postgres DB
		// In the main func,the below peice of code would help us to connect the our golang repo with the postgres databse
          const (
            	host     = "localhost"
            	port     = 5432
            	user     = "postgres"
            	password = "admin"
            	dbname   = "shoppingdb"
            )
           	psqlconn := fmt.Sprintf("host=%s port=%d user=%s password=%s dbname=%s sslmode=disable", host, port, user, password, dbname)
        	db, err = sql.Open("postgres", psqlconn)
        	if err != nil {
        		log.Printf("Error %s when opening DB\n", err)
        		return
        	}
# 3. Check if the connection has been established
		// once the connection has been established, we can check if the connection is successful by pinging the database:-
           	err = db.Ping()
            if err != nil {
                log.Printf("Error %s when pinging DB\n", err)
                return
            }
